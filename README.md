# MATLAB Audio Filter App

This MATLAB-designed audio filter application is a simple and interactive tool for real-time audio processing. Users can load .wav files, apply digital filters, and adjust settings with ease. The app supports finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters, offering low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop options. Filter parameters like cutoff frequency and order can be adjusted dynamically using sliders and menus. The app also visualizes audio signals in the time domain (waveform), and frequency domain (spectrum via Fast Fourier Transform), and displays the magnitude and phase response of the filters. Additionally, users can play back both the original and filtered audio to hear the effects of their adjustments. This application is ideal for learning, experimenting, and analyzing audio processing concepts.

##

1. Open the "proj_final_exported.m" in the MATLAB application, making sure the other files in the same directory/folder as well. 
2. Run the .m file.
3. Check the Help button of the Audio Filter app after running it in MATLAB to further understand how to use it.
